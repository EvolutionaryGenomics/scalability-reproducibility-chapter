Please check out this repository and provide your working example and paragraph using pull requests.

There are separate folders for each tool, the commands.sh contains the command lines to run an analysis on a single group of proteins.

Inside the Docker folder there is the Dockerfile to create the container with all the necessary software to run the analysis.

Thanks !!
